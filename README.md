# Hi, i'm Kaique Campos 👋
  **🌎 Learning and using knowledge to solve problems through technology is the fuel of my mind. 🧠**

☄️ I like to study technology and apply it in projects. In these projects I develop platforms using React, Next.js and React Native both with Typescript. Consumption of external APIs or created by me using NodeJS or AdonisJS. In addition, I like to study development ways that optimize the platform and improve the user experience both in terms of design and usability. ☄️

 - 💻 I’m currently learning NextJS, React and Typescript;
 - 🔥  I'm always open to new challenges.
